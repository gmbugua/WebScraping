# Web Scraper in Python
## What it does:
I made this tool to scrape the New York Times' Technology page. Future design goals are to make it more modular. That way the tool is more useful @ scraping different news sources.

## Frameworks:
   1. Beautiful Soup 4
   2. Requests

## Files
### Tool: web_scraper.py


### Test Files
1. test_scrape.html
2. scrape_test.py

###### The files listed above coincide with Corey Shaffer's Web
###### Scraping Tutorial. They are test files for the Web Scraping Tool I built.

## Output
###### CSV File containing the data scraped, specifically the article names, summary, authors and link.
