# Web Scraper in Python
## What it does:
I made this tool to scrape the New York Times' Technology page. Future design goals are to make it more modular. That way the tool is more useful @ scraping different news sources.

## Frameworks:
    * Beautiful Soup 4
    * Requests

## Files

### Tool
    * web_scraper.py


### Test Files
    * test_scrape.html
    * scrape_test.py

###### The test files listed above coincide with Corey Shaffer's Web Scraping Tutorial. They are test files for the Web Scraping Tool I built.

## Output
###### CSV File containing the data scraped, specifically the article names, summary, authors and link.
